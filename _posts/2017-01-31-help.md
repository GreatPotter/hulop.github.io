## Mode
* Select one of the following 3 modes of use at application startup depending on your personal needs.

* **Visually Impaired Person MODE**:
  * This mode of use enables non-visual voice navigation by providing precise direction and distance cues to follow in order to reach your destination. This mode is designed to be used together with VoiceOver.
  * In this mode, we recommend keeping your iPhone in a given position (e.g., keep in your pochette, etc.) 
* **Wheelchair User MODE**:
  * This mode of use is intended to provide best wheelchair accessible routes. The application also enables to reach your destination by voice navigation, although the amount of voice commands used here is fewer compared to the visually impaired person mode.
