Navcog is a navigation software, similar to GPS navigation used when driving by car. This page will explain how to use NavCog

## Mode Selection
At application startup select one of the following 3 modes of use depending on your needs:

* **Visually Impaired Person Mode**:
  * This mode of use enables non-visual voice navigation by providing precise direction and distance cues to follow in order to reach your destination. This mode is designed to be used together with VoiceOver.
* **Wheelchair User Mode**:
  * This mode of use is intended to provide best wheelchair accessible routes. The application also enables to reach your destination by voice navigation, although the number of voice commands used here is fewer compared to the visually impaired person mode.
* **General Pedestrian Mode**:
  * This mode of use provides the shortest route to your destination. Apart from this, the application works just like in the wheelchair user mode.

## Interface
The main interface shows the environment map, your position, and the traversed path.
Additional 3 elements are available:

* **Search** - The search button in top right corner will take you to the destination search screen.
  * Select a destination in the "TO" field right underneath. It is possible to do a voice search, or select from a list of possible destinations.
  * You can select one of your recent routes from the list in the middle of the screen.
  * Route options will allow you to set parameters for the navigation

* **Settings** - Settings button is on top left of the interface and it will allow you to change app preferences. In addition to general settings, each navigation mode will have other specific settings
  * Speech speed: Specify the speed of voice for both the navigation audio guide and the dialogue assistant.
  * Open Help Page: open this page.

* **Voice Search** - In the bottom left of the map screen, tap the microphone icon to start the dialogue assistant and choose your destination by talking with the application.
If the application can not determine your current location, the voice search is disabled.


## Instructions for Visually Impaired Users

When you start the navigation, hold the phone in your free hand in front of you. You will first hear a high level description of the route: its destination and length, followed by the first instruction (e.g., go straight and turn left in 30ft).Before each instruction, the system will ask for your attention with a vibration and a short ping sound. While you are walking towards the next turning point the system will periodically tell you the distance to it and it will tell “approaching” when you are close to it. After that the phone will tell you to turn. A turn is in general about 90°, while a slight turn is smaller. The phone will play a sound and vibrate when you have turned enough, so be careful not to turn too little or too much. Afterwards, the system will give you the distance to the next turning point and it will hint what will the next turn be (e.g, turn left at the end of the corridor). While navigating the phone will also tell you information about the environment, for example when the floor changes from carpet to marble, and when you have features of interest (restrooms, water fountains, notable places) or obstacles near you while traversing the environment. Use that information for avoiding collisions and as a confirmation during navigation. The only possible command is a tap on the screen, which will say your current status in case you need confirmation on where you are (for instance, proceed 20 feet and turn right)."

**NOTE: If silent mode is turned on, sound effects will not be heard.**

**Specific Settings:**

* Use Vibration: Use iPhone vibration to inform about turns, etc.
* Use Sound Effect: Use iPhone speakers to inform about turns, etc.
* Sound Effect for Bone Conduction Headset: Change to a suitable sound effect for bone conduction headset.
* Distance Unit: switch the distance unit between meters and feet.
* Guidance Instructions Only: Do not read facility information such as rooms, offices, restrooms...
