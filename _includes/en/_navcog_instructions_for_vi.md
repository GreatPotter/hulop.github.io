## Instructions for Visually Impaired Users

When you start the navigation, hold the phone in your free hand in front of you. You will first hear a high level description of the route: its destination and length, followed by the first instruction (e.g., go straight and turn left in 30ft).Before each instruction, the system will ask for your attention with a vibration and a short ping sound. While you are walking towards the next turning point the system will periodically tell you the distance to it and it will tell “approaching” when you are close to it. After that the phone will tell you to turn. A turn is in general about 90°, while a slight turn is smaller. The phone will play a sound and vibrate when you have turned enough, so be careful not to turn too little or too much. Afterwards, the system will give you the distance to the next turning point and it will hint what will the next turn be (e.g, turn left at the end of the corridor). While navigating the phone will also tell you information about the environment, for example when the floor changes from carpet to marble, and when you have features of interest (restrooms, water fountains, notable places) or obstacles near you while traversing the environment. Use that information for avoiding collisions and as a confirmation during navigation. The only possible command is a tap on the screen, which will say your current status in case you need confirmation on where you are (for instance, proceed 20 feet and turn right)."
