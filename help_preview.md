# Help for NavCog Preview

In this page you can find the description of the NavCog Preview application, including all the commands, important information about the current experiment, and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

## NavCog Preview description
NavCog Preview enables users to simulate a pre-defined route. This intends to increase the knowledge about a particular area before visiting it in person.
Being provided a starting point and a destination, the NavCog Preview provides turn-by-turn instructions to reach the destination, as well as information about important landmarks and Points of Interest that can be found on the way.

## NavCog Preview and CMU Experiment
In this experiment, you will have access to a fixed number of routes. When you start, you will only have access to a practice route, which you can use to learn how to interact with the NavCog Preview. Feel free to contact the researcher (Joao Guerreiro) in case you need to clarify any issue.
Afterwards, you will have access to two different routes, which you will be able to preview every day for a limited amount of time (20 minutes), before going to the real-world experiment at CMU. We ask you to try to learn as much as you can about those routes.
During these days we will call you and ask you information about those routes. We ask you to rely exclusively on your memory from the interaction with the system. Please do not take any notes about the route nor record the interaction with the system.


## NavCog Preview Commands
Here we describe the different gestures and commands that can be used to interact with NavCog Preview.

### Swipe-Up - Move (or Jump) to the next intersection or point-of-interest
A Swipe-Up moves the user to the next intersection, point-of-interest or landmark, whichever comes first. After swiping, you can hear a quick-sound of steps to indicate movement, the distance travelled (for instance "30 feet walked") and the next instruction (for instance, "turn right").

### Swipe-Down - Move (or Jump) to the previous intersection or point-of-interest
A Swipe-Down moves the user to the previous intersection, point-of-interest or landmark, whichever comes first. After swiping, you can hear a quick-sound of steps to indicate movement, the distance travelled (for instance "30 feet walked back") and the next instruction (for instance, "proceed 10 feet and turn right").

### Two-Finger Swipe-Down - Start walking at a fixed speed
A Two-Finger Swipe-Up initiates walking at a fixed speed. The user can hear the steps, indicating one step forward, and is informed about the landmarks he is passing by (for example "a column is on your right") and the required instructions (for example "proceed 20 meters" or "turn left").
If already walking, another Two-Finger Swipe-Up increases the speed, while a Two-Finger Swipe-Down reduces the speed.
A single tap on the screen stops the walking.

### Two-Finger Swipe-Down - Reduce walking speed
In case the user initiates automatic walking, a Two-Finger Swipe-Down reduces the walking speed. 

### Three-Finger Swipe-Up - Move or (jump) to the next intersection
Similar to the regular Swipe-Up, but does not consider landmarks and points-of-interest. It moves the user immediately to the next intersection without stopping at the other points of interest.
After swiping, you may hear a quick-sound of steps to indicate movement, the distance travelled (for instance "30 feet walked") and the next instruction (for instance, "turn right").

### Three-Finger Swipe-Down - Move or (jump) to the previous intersection
Similar to the Three-Finger Swipe-Up, but moves the user to the previous intersection. It also does not consider landmarks or points of interest.

### Swipe-Left and Swipe-Right - Turn left and Turn right
When the user needs to make a turn in order to continue on the route, the smartphone vibrates and the system announces that a turn is required (for example "turn right" or "slight right"). In order to turn, the user can make swipe in the direction of the required turn (left or right). A confirmation sound is provided if the turn is succeeded. 

### Rotate the smartphone left or right - Turn left and Turn right
Another way to make a turn is to rotate the phone as if actually turning to the required direction. A confirmation sound is also provided when the turn is completed. The user is then able to return the phone to its original orientation, or keep it with the same orientation after the turn. 

### Tap the phone - Stop walking
In case the walking is activated (with the Two-Finger Swipe-Up), a single tap on the phone will stop the automatic walking.

### Shake the Smartphone - Quit the current route
In order to quit the current route, the user may select the button on the top-right of the screen. However, another option is to shake the smartphone.
